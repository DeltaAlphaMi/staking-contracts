# staking-contracts

This project contains two smart contracts, one for the Token which we will create and deploy, and one for the StakingContract 
which can handle to simple functions(deposit and withdraw).

The user can call the deposit function in order to stake some ETH and earn 10% APY in the Token which we have created at any
time by a call to the other function in this contract withdraw.
